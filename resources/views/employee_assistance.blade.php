                    <h3><b>What is an Employee Assistance Programme (EAP)</b></h3>
                    An employee assistance program (EAP) is an employee benefit program that assists employees with personal
                    problems and/or work-related problems that may impact their job performance, For workers, employee
                    assistance programs can be a much-needed outlet to seek help. But there are benefits to employers who
                    implement employee assistance programs too.<br>
                    Services offered under EAP assist in resolving conflict, reducing workplace risks and enhancing
                    capability and resilience in individuals and teams.<br>
                    Besides improving employee productivity and decreasing sick days and leaves of absence, all of which
                    reduce operating costs, wellness programs may lower an organization’s health insurance expenses.
                    Employees can also benefit from wellness programs through lower health insurance premiums, decreased
                    out-of-pocket medical expenditures and an increased sense of well-being.<br>
                    Corporate wellness programs offer a variety of scheduled programs, such as stress management seminars
                    that address everything from sleep to work-life balance to financial health; cooking classes; healthy
                    recipe exchanges and fitness challenges. <br>
                    An employer approach to improving employee health, wellness programs include activities such as
                    company-sponsored exercise, weight-loss competitions, educational seminars, tobacco-cessation programs
                    and health screenings that are designed to help employees eat better, lose weight and improve their
                    overall physical health.<br>
                    EAP may include : health, mental and emotional well-being including rehabilitation family/personal

                    The scope will vary from company to company, but here are some examples of things employee assistance
                    programs can support: <br>
                    Really, any issue that is causing employees mental or emotional distress is fair game with an EAP. <br>
                    <h4><b>What are some employee assistance program benefits for employers?</b> </h4><br>
                    Increased productivity and retention, lower insurance costs, and more.
                    <ol>
                        <li>• Increased productivity. Workers with depressive symptoms are more likely to be absent due to
                            illness or accidents, and even when they are at work, they can be checked out (a phenomenon
                            known as presenteeism). EAPs can give these workers the help they need so they can be back at
                            full productivity.</li>
                        <li>• Greater retention. Eighty-six percent of employees now believe a company’s culture should
                            support mental health. It’s a make-or-break issue for many, especially younger workers. An EAP
                            is a signal that you’re listening and that you care, which—in turn—can aid recruiting and
                            retention efforts.</li>
                        <li>• Lower insurance costs. Just as employer-sponsored biometric screenings can detect early signs
                            of disease, EAPs can also catch the beginnings of larger issues that would have ended up costing
                            you a lot more down the line.</li>
                        <li>• Lightening the burden for managers. Managers aren’t necessarily equipped with the skills to
                            help their employees in the case of something traumatic, like a death in the family.
                            Implementing an EAP can give your managers a resource to rely on in difficult situations.</li>
                    </ol>
